class Status:
    """
    This model represents and holds all the information of a status.

    :ivar id_: Status id
    :ivar account_id: Id of the account associated to this status
    :ivar text: Text of the status
    :ivar username: Name of the user that updated the status
    :ivar avatar: Display image of the user that updated the status
    :ivar source: Client used to upload this status
    :ivar timestamp: Time of publishing of this status (Unix time)
    :ivar in_reply_to_id: Contains the id of the status answered (if any)
    :ivar in_reply_to_user: Contains the user answered with status (if any)
    :ivar is_favorite: `True` if this status has been marked as favorite. `False` otherwise
    :ivar is_protected: `True` if this status is from a protected account. `False` otherwise
    :ivar is_verified: `True` if this status is from a verified account. `False` otherwise
    :ivar repeated: `True` if this status has been repeated (retweeted) by you. `False` otherwise
    :ivar repeated_by: More users that have repeated this status
    :ivar repeated_count: How much times this status has been repeated
    :ivar original_status_id: Id of the original status (not-repeated)
    :ivar created_at: Original timestamp from the service
    :ivar datetime: Humanized representation of the date/time of this status
    :ivar is_own: `True` if the status belongs to the same user of the associated account. `False` otherwise
    :ivar entities: A dict with all the entities found in status
    :ivar type_: Status type.

    Sometimes a status can hold one or more entities (URLs, hashtags, etc). In this
    case the entities variable will store a dict with lists for each category.
    For example:

    >>> status.entities
    {'urls': [], 'hashtags': [], 'mentions': [], 'groups': []}

    A status can handle two possible types:
    :class:`libturpial.api.models.status.Status.NORMAL` for regular statuses
    or :class:`libturpial.api.models.status.Status.DIRECT` for private
    (direct) statuses.
